# Debt Management: Your Guide to Financial Freedom

## Understanding Debt

Debt is money you owe to lenders. While some debt can be beneficial (like mortgages), high-interest debt can significantly impact your financial health and limit your ability to build wealth.

## Types of Debt

### Good Debt vs. Bad Debt

**Good Debt** (potentially tax-deductible, builds wealth):
- Mortgages: Real estate typically appreciates
- Student loans: Education increases earning potential
- Business loans: Can generate income
- Low-interest car loans: Necessary transportation

**Bad Debt** (high interest, no wealth building):
- Credit card debt: High interest rates
- Payday loans: Extremely high fees and rates
- Personal loans for consumption: No asset backing
- Store credit cards: Often high interest rates

## Debt Repayment Strategies

### 1. Debt Snowball Method
- Pay minimums on all debts
- Put extra money toward smallest balance first
- Once paid off, roll that payment to next smallest debt
- **Pros**: Quick wins, psychological motivation
- **Cons**: May pay more interest overall

### 2. Debt Avalanche Method
- Pay minimums on all debts
- Put extra money toward highest interest rate first
- **Pros**: Saves most money on interest
- **Cons**: May take longer to see progress

### 3. Debt Consolidation
- Combine multiple debts into one payment
- Potentially lower interest rate
- Simplified payment management
- **Warning**: Doesn't address spending habits

## Credit Cards and High-Interest Debt

### Credit Card Basics
- Average APR: 16-25%
- Minimum payments mostly go to interest
- Compound interest works against you
- Can take decades to pay off with minimums only

### Credit Card Payoff Strategies
1. **Stop using cards**: Don't add new debt
2. **Pay more than minimum**: Even $25 extra makes a difference  
3. **Consider balance transfers**: 0% promotional rates
4. **Pay highest rate first**: Unless using snowball method
5. **Use windfalls**: Tax refunds, bonuses toward debt
